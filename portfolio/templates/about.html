            Hi, my name is Risto.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2020 I gratuated from LAB University of Applied Sciences with a degree in International Business.
            Before that, I studied computer programming, but quit at the beginning of the final year.
            Now, almost 10 years later I have been attempting a comeback into programming.
            I am most familiar with Python and Swift, but I have also been learning some Java and R.
            I would like to learn more about Full Stack development, so I do plan on starting to study JavaScript as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am also a studying for a Master's degree in Supply Management at LUT University with a minor in Digitalization and Business Analytics.
            In my spare time I like to play guitar, bike, run and play video games.
